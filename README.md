Advanced damage calculator for Genshin Impact. 

Written by `Bygdle#8333`. If you find a bug or have any suggestion, please contact me via Discord.

## Notes
- Attack Speed buffs are not taken into account by the calculator. If you want to include any effect of this type, consider creating modified rotations for that prupose.
- Energy Requeriments are not directly taken into account by the calculator. Some tools like the optimizers can be configured to apply filters, so you can use that to consider the ER%.
