@title: Xingqiu QEE > Yelan EQ > Zhongli E > Hu Tao 9x(N1C) + Q
@characters: Hu Tao C1, Xingqiu C6, Yelan C0, Zhongli C0
@description:
A full-team rotation for Hu Tao.

- Assumed Xingqiu with Sacrificial Sword, for that reason is the double E cast.
- Configured Yelan for activating Elegy buff.
- Configured Zhongli for activating Instructor buff.
- Assumed hydro aura with 100% uptime.
- Assumed Hu Tao vaporizes all her charged attacks (reaction uptime 100%).
- Assumed Zhongli doesn't cast his Q and his Pilar resonance doesn't hit the enemy.
- Assumed Hu Tao casts her Q every other rotation.

Note that Elegy and Instructor should be equipped on their corresponding characters
for the effect activation to be done. Otherwise, the action will just be skipped.

> This rotation will work even if any of the 4 characters is missing from the party,
so you can still use it to calculate solo damage.

Is a good idea to type the `effect unset` and `character unset` commands
when we are no longer using the previously set character and/or effect.
This avoid unwanted modifications if a later `character set` or `effect set`
doesn't work because of that character/effect not being found.

/*
The *2 multipliers are to consider the Sacrificial Sword passive is
triggered. You could instead use an average value, for example, 
Sacrificial R3 against a single enemy has a total activation probability 
of 84% (1-(1-0.6)^2 = 0.84), so the multiplier would be *1.84.
